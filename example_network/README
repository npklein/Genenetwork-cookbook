# Example genenetwork creation
This directory contains all the steps needed to create a GeneNetwork on samples from a randomly chosen, small dataset on the Europen Nucleotide Archive: [PRJNA233428](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJNA233428)<sup>[1](#citations)</sup>. 

To follow along it is assumed that you have code from https://github.com/npklein/brain_eQTL/ in the same directory. You can
get this by running `git clone https://github.com/npklein/brain_eQTL.git` in your terminal.
